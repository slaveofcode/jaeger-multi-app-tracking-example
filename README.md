# Jaeger Multi App Tracking Example ðŸ“Š 
Example implementation of multi application tracking with jaeger tracing.

This project has 3 different applications, 

1. `api-a`, is simple NodeJs app called **Service A**
2. `api-b`, is simple NodeJs app called **Service B**
3. `api-c`, is simple Golang app called **Service C** 

In operation, the **Service A** is depends on **Service B** and **C**, mimicking microservices architecture, so then you'll get the idea about how opentracing works in practice using Jaeger as a backend.

### How to Start
1. Make sure your environment already setup for NodeJs and Go (with go module support)
2. Clone this repostory `git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:slaveofcode/jaeger-multi-app-tracking-example.git`
3. Start **Service A** by go to `api-a` directory and run command `npm start`, the same steps applied to **Service B** on `api-b`
4. Start **Service C** by go to `api-c` directory and run command `go run server.go`
5. Start the Jaeger `jaeger-all-in-one` service, you can use the *binary* or using its **Docker** image as [described here](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.18/getting-started/) 
6. Start making some requests by hitting [http://localhost:8110/api/users](http://localhost:8110/api/users) and [http://localhost:8110/api/users/1](http://localhost:8110/api/users/1)
7. Visit **Jaeger UI** at [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686) and select **Service A** on the Filter Search box to see some traces.
